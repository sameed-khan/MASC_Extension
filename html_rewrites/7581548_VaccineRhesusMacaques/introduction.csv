adenovirus vectors,Vectors can be thought of as packages that contain genetic or protein material that can be delivered to your cells. Adenoviruses are commonly used as vectors: they carry the coronavirus spike protein and inject it into your body. The immune system learns the spike protein and uses that knowledge to recognize the COVID virus if you were infected. ,Centers for Disease Control: What is a viral vector vaccine?|https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/viralvector.html,News Medical: Adenovirus-based vaccines|https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-are-Adenovirus-Based-Vaccines.aspx,Some history on adenovirus vaccines|https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/vaccines/Adenoviral-vectors-new-COVID-19/98/i19
immunogenicity,Immunogenicity refers to a substance's ability to induce a strong immune response from the body. A stronger immune response to a vaccine means the body is better primed to respond to an actual threat. Immunogenicity is one measure of how scientists evaluate the effectiveness of a vaccine and can be estimated by looking at specific measures such as antibody levels.,AstraZeneca: What is immunogenicity?|https://www.astrazeneca.com/what-science-can-do/topics/disease-understanding/what-does-immunogenicity-mean-in-the-context-of-covid-19-vaccines.html,,
protective efficacy,"Protective efficacy simply refers to how well a vaccine reduces the severity of COVID, assuming someone has been infected. In this study, the authors measured protective efficacy by looking at viral load - the amount of actual COVID virus present in the macaques.",Medpage Today: How viral load relates to vaccine protectiveness|https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/88692,,
