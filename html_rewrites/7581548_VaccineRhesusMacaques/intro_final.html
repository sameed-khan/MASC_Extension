<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17329340/">Previous studies</a> have shown that <span class="special_term">adenovirus vectors<span class="term_tooltip">Vectors can be thought of as packages that contain genetic or protein material that can be delivered to your cells. Adenoviruses are commonly used as vectors: they carry the coronavirus spike protein and inject it into your body. The immune system learns the spike protein and uses that knowledge to recognize the COVID virus if you were infected. <span class="borderline">&nbsp;<span class="reference_grid"><img class="img_bullet"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/viralvector.html" class="ref_link">Centers for Disease Control: What is a viral vector vaccine?</a><img class="img_bullet"><a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-are-Adenovirus-Based-Vaccines.aspx" class="ref_link">News Medical: Adenovirus-based vaccines</a><img class="img_bullet"><a href="https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/vaccines/Adenoviral-vectors-new-COVID-19/98/i19" class="ref_link">Some history on adenovirus vaccines</a></span></span></span></span> are particularly effective at inducing strong immune responses from the body.

A stronger immune response to a vaccine means the body is better primed to respond to an actual threat. Immunogenicity is one measure of how scientists evaluate the effectiveness of a vaccine and can be estimated by looking at specific measures such as antibody levels.<span class="borderline">&nbsp;<span class="reference_grid"><img class="img_bullet"><a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/what-science-can-do/topics/disease-understanding/what-does-immunogenicity-mean-in-the-context-of-covid-19-vaccines.html" class="ref_link">AstraZeneca: What is immunogenicity?</a></span></span></span></span> and <span class="special_term">protective efficacy<span class="term_tooltip">Protective efficacy simply refers to how well a vaccine reduces the severity of COVID, assuming someone has been infected.
