A vaccine may be necessary to end the pandemic. The best vaccine would be a one-time shot that is easiest to distribute globally. In this article, we are going to show the effectiveness of a

<span class="term_tooltip">A <strong>viral vector vaccine</strong> uses a non-infectious virus to deliver a piece of the disease-causing germ (this piece is known as an antigen) to your cells. The virus itself is called the <strong>vector</strong>.

that we tested in rhesus macaques. 52 rhesus macaques were immunized with either the experimental vaccine (termed "Ad26") or a
<a class ="special_term">&nbsp;sham control&nbsp;
<span class="term_tooltip">A&nbsp;<strong>sham control</strong>&nbsp;in this case refers to injecting the monkeys with an ingredient that has no effect.
&nbsp;A control was used in this experiment so that experimenters could know how the monkeys coped with COVID-19 at baseline. By comparing the health of
&nbsp;the vaccinated group to the control group, they are able to actually know how effective their experimental Ad26 vaccine is. A "sham" is a type of
&nbsp;control where some sort of surgical or physical intervention takes place (as opposed to a "placebo" which is a control used with drugs. The intervention
&nbsp;is still performed but in such a way that no effect actually takes place.

and were exposed to the COVID virus by breathing it in through their nose or their mouth. We found that the Ad26 vaccine induced a

and resulted in vaccinated monkeys having a lower

Studies have shown that viral load is a useful way of measuring how "sick" a COVID-infected person (or monkey) is.

in their bodies compared to the control group. This vaccine, officially designated as "Ad26.COV2.S" is currently being evaluated in clinical trials.
